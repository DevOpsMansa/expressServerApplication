# Express Server Application

## Introduction
This assessment measures your understanding of Node and Express and your capability to implement their features in a practical manner. You have creative freedom in the topic, material, and purpose of the web application you will be developing, so have fun with it! However, remember to plan the scope of your project to the timeline you have been given.

## Objectives
* Create a server application with Node and Express. 
* Create a RESTful API using Express.
* Create Express middleware.
* Use Express middleware.
* Use a template engine to render views with Express. 
* Interact with a self-made API through HTML forms.

## Instructions
You will create a small Node and Express server application. The topic and content of this application is entirely up to your creativy!
Creativity and effort always work in your favor, so feel free to go beyond the scope of the listed requirements.

## Requirements
The requirements listed here are absolute minimums. Ensure that your application meets these requirements before attempting to further expand your features.

* Create and use at least two pieces of custom middleware.
Create and use error-handling middleware.

* Use at least three different data categories (e.g., users, posts, or comments).

* Utilize reasonable data structuring practices.

* Create GET routes for all data that should be exposed to the client.

* Create POST routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client creation via a POST request.

* Create PATCH or PUT routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client manipulation via a PATCH or PUT request.

* Create DELETE routes for data, as appropriate. At least one data category should allow for client deletion via a DELETE request.

* Include query parameters for data filtering, where appropriate. At least one data category should allow for additional filtering through the use of query parameters.
Note: DO NOT use API keys; this makes it more diffcult for instructors to grade finished projects efficiently.

* Utilize route parameters, where appropriate.
 
* Adhere to the guiding principles of REST.

* Create and render at least one view using a view template and template engine. This can be a custom template engine or a third-party engine.

* If you are stuck on how to approach this, think about ways you could render the current state of your API's data for easy viewing.

* Use simple CSS to style the rendered views.
Note: This is not a test of design; it is a test of serving static files using Express. The CSS can be very simple.

* Include a form within a rendered view that allows for interaction with your RESTful API.
Weight

* Utilize reasonable code organization practices.

* Ensure that the program runs without errors (comment out things that do not work, and explain your blockers - you can still receive partial credit).

Commit frequently to the git repository.
* Include a README file that contains a description of your application.

* Level of effort displayed in creativity, presentation, and user experience.

## Bonus Objectives
The objectives listed here are not required. Ensure that your application meets the requirements above before attempting to further expand your features.
Ensure your application works as outlined by the requirements above before attempting these objectives, time permitting.

* Include a practical usage of regular expressions within route paths.
Note: A forced, arbitrary usage of this technique will not earn you any bonus credit. This must be practical and sensible in order to be considered for credit.

* Research and effectively use at least one third-party Node package for practical, sensible purposes.

* This cannot be a package that has been used in examples and lesson materials thus far. Step outside the box and be creative!

## Reflection (Optional)
Once you have completed your project, answer the following questions to help solidify your understanding of the process and its outcomes, as well as improve your ability to handle similar tasks in the future.

    * What could you have done differently during the planning stages of your project to make the execution easier?
       
   * Were there any requirements that were diffcult to implement? What do you think would make them easier to implement in future projects?

    * What would you add to or change about your application if given more time?

    * Use this space to make notes for your future self about anything that you think is important to remember about this process or that may aid you when attempting something similar.

## Installations:
* Morgan -  Logs a message anytime we make a request
* ejs -  Embedded Javascript Templating is a templating engine used by Node.js. Template engine helps to create an HTML template with minimal code. Also, it can inject data into an HTML template on the client side and produce the final HTML.
* Body-Parser - processes incoming request bodies, making it easier to handle POST and PUT requests. By parsing the body of an HTTP request and attaching it to the req. body property, it simplifies data extraction and manipulation in server-side logic. Allows us to serilize the data = an access the form data using the body property
* dot evn module - Allows you to separate the secrete from your source code.
